	<h2>OpenD Language Reference</h2>

	<p>OpenD is very similar to Walter Bright's D Programming Language. Until we get everything written, use those resources to learn the language, then see the <a href="changes.html">list of changes</a> to learn the rest.</p>

	<p>See the <a href="language/index.html">language reference index</a> for details.</p>
