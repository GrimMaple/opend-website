<p>We still need to set this up in detail! The OpenD language was just created on January 1, 2024.</p>

<h2>Download from github</h2>

<p>You can download the prebuilt releases <a href="https://github.com/opendlang/opend/releases">here from github</a>.</p>

<p>There are two compilers built from the OpenD source: the quick compiler, based on Digital Mars' dmd code, and the optimizing cross-capable compiler, based on LDC's llvm code.</p>

<p>The prebuilt release comes with the ldc program.</p>

<p>However, if you build it yourself, the dmd-based quick compiler is usually easier and faster to compile.</p>

<h2>Building the compiler</h2>

<p>The compiler code itself is compatible with upstream D, so you can bootstrap it using those compilers.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<h4>dmd-based compiler</h4>

<p>On Windows, you will want <a href="https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm">GNU make</a> (make sure you get the two dlls it depends on too, from the same website) and an upstream D compiler to get started. Run make from inside the "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" that VS install sets up. You might want to copy the make exe and dlls into the dmd bin folder.</p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/opendlang/opend.git
cd opend
cd compiler\src
dmd build
build
cd ../../druntime
make
cd ../phobos
make
</pre>

<p>You can then use opend\generated\windows\release\64\dmd.exe, God willing.</p>

<h4>ldc-based compiler</h4>

<p>You'll need cmake (from cmake.org) and llvm (at least version 11.0, no newer than 17.0.1, from releases.llvm.org/download.html) installed.</p>

<p>LLVM's website doesn't offer a complete download for Windows. So this won't work</p>

<p>https://github.com/c3lang/win-llvm/releases/tag/llvm_16_0_2 offers a download that works though...</p>

<p>mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DLLVM_ROOT_DIR="c:\Users\adamd\Downloads\llvm-16.0.2-windows-x86-msvc17-msvcrt\"</p>

<p>Open the .sln file in Visual Studio and click the build option in the right click menu of the ALL_BUILD project. hope it works... it didn't for me though</p>

alternatively maybe:

<ol>
	<li>Download cmake and put it in your path. Its installer can do this for you.</li>
	<li>Download llvm binary build. The thing from the official llvm website does NOT work but there are others out there. Put the path to llvm bin in your PATH.</li>
	<!-- Their website links to github, then you probably want LLVM-16.0.4-win64.exe which you can run to install it. Windows Defender might complain about it but it worked for me. Put it in your path; the installer can do this for you again. -->
	<li>Open a x64 Native Tools Command Prompt from your VS install</li>
	<li><code>cd \path\to\opend</code></li>
	<li><code>cd ldc</code></li>
	<li><code>mkdir build</code></li>
	<li><code>cd build</code></li>
	<li>...hit a wall because the cmake thing looks for llvm-config which is not included in the download. ugh. Need to adjust again.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<h4>Initial setup</h4>

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/opendlang/opend.git
</pre>

<h4>dmd-based compiler</h4>

<pre>
# cd into your clone...
cd opend
cd compiler
make -j8 dmd
make -j8 druntime
./generated/linux/release/64/dmd --version
</pre>

<h4>ldc-based compiler</h4>

<pre>
# cd into your clone...
cd opend
cd ldc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
./bin/ldc2 --version
</pre>



<h2>Please help!</h2>

<p>If you know how to adapt CI scripts to do release downloads, please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.</p>

<h2>Aspirational ideas</h2>

<p>The plan is to do something like</p>

<ol>
	<li>Download</li>
	<li>Unzip</li>
	<li>Run</li>
	<li>(Optional) Install</li>
</ol>

<pre>
# to install it to your path
opend please install

# to download optional components
opend please setup-compiler

opend please setup-project

# to build
opend yourfile
# or
opend please build yourfile

# to precompile a library
opend please build arsd.cgi
</pre>
