<p>We still need to set this up! The OpenD language was just created on January 1, 2023.</p>

<p>If you know how to adapt CI scripts to do release downloads, please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>The plan is to do something like</p>

<ol>
	<li>Download</li>
	<li>Unzip</li>
	<li>Run</li>
	<li>(Optional) Install</li>
</ol>

<pre>
# to install it to your path

# to download optional components
opend please setup-compiler

opend please setup-project

# to build
opend yourfile
# or
opend please build yourfile

# to precompile a library

</pre>
