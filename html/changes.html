	<h1>Changes from the upstream D Language</h1>
	<p>OpenD forked off upstream D on January 1, 2024. Since then, some things have diverged. This page lists the differences.</p>

	<p>Items are tagged <tt>[parser]</tt> if it had a parser change, <tt>[library]</tt> if a library change, and <tt>[experimental]</tt> if it is still subject to further major change at this time.</p>

	<h2>Additions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>[parser] Interpolated expression sequences added</li>
		<li>0o777 octal literals added</li>
		<li>`version(D_OpenD)` is defined to identify the forked compiler</li>
		<li>`__traits(docComment, symbol)` is added to get the ddoc comment attached to a symbol</li>
		<li>[experimental] You can name unittests with `unittest "your name" { ... }`</li>
		<li>opUnaryRight, enables overriding the default behavior for post increment and post decrement</li>
		<li>[library] Atomic!T, an atomic type similar to what is provided with std::atomic in C++</li>
		<li>[parser] [experimental] You can name unittests with `unittest "your name" { ... }`</li>
		<li>[experimental] `opImplicitCast` added, which allows implicit conversions on function parameter passing or direct assignments to arbitrary types.</li>
		<li>`@implicit this()` constructors added, which allows implicit construction when passing arguments to functions.</li>
		<li>[parser] `private(this)` added for class-level private</li>
		<li>`-unittest=x` can take module patterns</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Changes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If a module is imported, it <b>must</b> have a module declaration at the top of the file, and it must match the import name.</li>
		<li>Files with invalid identifier chars might be modified to make a working anonymous name if and only if they are a top-level module, not imported by other things</li>
		<li>Bug fix for extern(C++) multiple inheritance merged (possibly regression causing but passes all tests so far</li>
		<li>`-preview=bitfields` is not supported. C style bitfields are a mistake to copy into D. You can still use them with C code (including with the importC feature).</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Packaging</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The dmd, druntime, phobos, and ldc repos are all merged to reduce duplicated work.</li>
		<li>dub, reggae, and rdmd are not packaged with OpenD. If you depend on them, the upstream versions should work if you use the `--compiler` option to them.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Things upstream added after OpenD</h1>
	<p>None yet, but interpolated expression sequences coming soon to them too.</p>
